## Clackamas County, OR
The Clackamas County Sheriffs likely use Axon products, as there's an unusually
high concentration of Axon MACs detected on WiGLE
[around the Sheriff's office.](https://wigle.net/mapsearch?maplat=45.42980931518206&maplon=-122.5694454370719&mapzoom=17&n=g2%20%2Fmapsearch)
The lack of similar concentrations around Portland Police Department locations
suggests that they may not be using Axon products.
